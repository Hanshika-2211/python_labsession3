# Python List Operations

This repository contains Python programs focusing on various list operations and matrix manipulations. Each code snippet demonstrates specific functionalities and operations related to lists and matrices.

## List of Codes:

### 1. **Print List (Code 1):**
   - Program to declare a list and print its elements.

### 2. **Print Elements by Index (Code 2):**
   - Print elements at each index value of the list.

### 3. **String List (Code 3):**
   - Print and declare a string list.

### 4. **Mixed Data Types List (Code 4):**
   - Program with a list containing mixed data types.

### 5. **Various Operations on List (Code 5):**
   - Perform various operations on a given list, including slicing, sorting, appending, popping, removing, inserting, counting, extending, and reversing.

### 6. **Even and Odd Sublists (Code 6):**
   - Create two sublists for even and odd numbers from a given list.

### 7. **Reverse List Iteration (Code 7):**
   - Program to iterate/traverse a list in reverse order using three methods: `reverse` keyword, slicing, and the `insert` method.

### 8. **List Concatenation (Code 8):**
   - Demonstrates list concatenation using the '+' operator, `append`, and `extend` methods.

### 9. **Sum and Mean of List (Code 9):**
   - Calculate the sum and mean of a given list.

### 10. **Remove Duplicates from List (Code 10):**
   - Remove all duplicates from a given list.

### 11. **Matrix Addition (Code 11):**
   - Add two matrices using nested lists.

**Feel free to explore, modify, and use these Python programs to deepen your understanding of list operations and matrix manipulations. Each code snippet is well-commented to aid comprehension. Happy coding!**
